# TopPriorityAction
WoW addon to propose actions. Implements combat action priority list (APL).

## Current
- Game version: 9.2.5
- Specs: feral, guardian

## Description
Uses retail WoW UI Lua.

### Limitations:
Made for personal use. Requests and issues are not accepted. Shared code might be usefull for other addon developers to find general hints and ideas.

My APL is different from SimCraft and AskMrRobot to fit my playstyle and gear. Supports only talents I use.

No UI, no ingame description. To visualise a proposed `TopPriorityActionSharedData.CurrentAction` Key / Name / Icon requires other addons (e.g. WeakAuras, TellMeWhen). No examples (import strings) provided.

With third-party visualization can be used as combat adviser. Also if combined with a visual spell tracker (e.g. TrufiGCD, Details module) can be used to compare suggested actions with your actual actions on recorded gameplay.

#### This addon does NOT execute any player action.
